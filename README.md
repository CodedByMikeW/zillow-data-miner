# zillow-data-miner
This project uses Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup (BS4) to automatically scrape rental property data from the Zillow website. The script extracts key information including the address, rent price, and Link. It then automates the submission of this data into a Google Form, which logs the entries into a connected Google Sheets spreadsheet.
